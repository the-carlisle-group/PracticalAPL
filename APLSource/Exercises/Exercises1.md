## Bill of Sale

Given a bill of sale:

|Item|Quantity|Price|Discount|
|:===|=======:|====:|=======:|
|Avocados| 15     | 2.50|   10%  |
|Limes   | 36     |  .75|   20%  |
|Chips   |  8     | 3.00|    5%  |


1. Create some variables to contain the data. (Hint there are three variables to create) 

2. Write an expression that computes the total cost with no discount.

3. Write an expression that computes the discounted prices for each item.

4. Write an expression that computes the total cost with the discount applied.  

5. Convert the expression in #2 to a function where the left argument is price
 and the right argument is quantity 

6. Write an expression that computes the most money spent on a single good.

7. Write a function that computes the average price of the goods.

8. Write a function that computes the average price weighted by the quantity.


## Bonus Question

Find the primitive function that looks like a circle with a vertical line throught it.
Play around with it in both its monadic and dyadic forms.
(Use a character vector, like your name, for the right argument)
Use this primitive function to write a function that returns a 1 if the right argument is a palindrome.
or a 0 if it is not. 

Hint: You will need a relational function and a logical function and an operator, all described in this lesson.
