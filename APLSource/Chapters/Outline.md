# Outline

Each chapter or section should have material for a 45 minute interactve class where students
are trying stuff out themselves.

Each chapter should have a problem set focused on cummulatively applying the concepts and functions
covered to date, around a particular theme (like Soduko, or converting Fahrenheit to Celcius,
or Wordle, or gas, or stats, etc.

1. Introduction

Numeric scalars and vectors, + - x ÷, scalar functions, scalar extension,
monadic and dyadic, ⌈ ⌊ *,|, negative numbers, E notation, order of operations, parentheses

3. Reduce Operator

/+/ ⌈/ ⌊/

2. Structural Functions

⍴ ⍳ ⌽ ⍉ ⊖ ↓ ↑, matrices, character data  

3. User define function

{⍺ ⍵} etc.

4. Tally, Shape and Rank 

≢ ⍴ and ⍴⍴

4. Nested Arrays

Depth, juxapostion, match catenate, ravel

6. The Each Operator

7. Trading rank and depth.

Mix and Split. Mixed arrays.

8. Enclose and Disclose (First) 



## Chapter 3: Indexing, Sorting, Searching, selecting.

Bracket indexing, squad, grade up and down, replicate, compress, expand, index of. 

## Chapter 4: Functions in Detail

Mutli-line dfns. Assignment, local variables. Nested Dfns. Dfns calling Dfns. Capsules. Scope, etc.

## Chapter 6.5 Rank and Axes.

Even more on arrays. Major cells. All the primitives that take axis specification.
The rank operator.

## Chapter 7: Namespaces for Organizing Functions 

)NS, )CS, ⎕THIS. #, ##, #.This.That. etc.

## Chapter 8: Working with HTML, Markdown, CSS
